    Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
  Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that helps create customized financial plans for its customers. 
  They had an existing app that they wanted to ensure was secure enough for thier customers to utilize without wory of their financial information being potentialy exposed to hackers.
  
    What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
  I think for this project, one thing I did well was generating the secure certificate for the app. I feel like I had a firm understanding of what I was doing during that process and was able to properly generate the certificate that the server can use to verify they are communicating to a legit client.
  
    Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
  I found it a bit challenging to get my web browser to recoginize the certificate that was generated. For some reason it kept telling me that they could not verify user created certificates. I did end up figuring it out after much trial and error.
  
    How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
  We increased the security by including an encryption algoritym to the code that allows for secure transfer of data between the server and the client.
  
    How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  After completing the code, I ensured it was functional by accessing the site on a web browser and ensuring that HTTPS was being used as opposed to just HTTP.
  
    What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  Using the vunerability assesment really helped make it clear all of the potential risks in the program and allowed us to make a plan to mitigate those concerns. 
  
    Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
  I could show them the implementation of the encryption algorithym as well as the certificate generation and validation.
